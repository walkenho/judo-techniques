# Judo Techniques
This is a collection of notes which I took while preparing for my brown belt exam in Spain in 2015.

Whilst I find it easy to remember standing techniques (they all have names),
I don't always remember the variety and intricacies of ground work. So I started writing them down
in detail to help me study and prepare. This is my personal intent to sort these notes and make them accessible 
both for myself for the future and possibly (?) for others.

When advancing in the study of judo, you are supposed to learn the vocabulary. 
Personally, I have always found that making sense of words in a structured manner helps me memorize them. In this 
context, these notes also include a glossary that are meant to support this effort. 

I have practiced Judo in German and in Spanish, but never in English (isn't life strange sometimes?). I am therefore not yet familiar with the 
common English terminology. In this sense, this is also an intent of familiarizing myself with the English terminology in preparation
of joining a club in Britain. The linguistic quality of these notes should therfore (hopefully) keep improving whilst 
I add new articles and descriptions. For the start I will be also using [blackbeltwiki](https://blackbeltwiki.com/) to help with the vocabulary.


TODO: 
* add Spanish translation
