## Attacks when Uke between Tori's legs

### Crab-Twisting Attack
1. Tori twists in crab-movement on their right side, introduces their right foot to Uke's left inner knee. Tori uses foot to roll Uke to Tori's left while blocking Uke's right leg with Tori's left leg. **Important**: Arm work to ensure Uke cannot counteract with their arms. In the right grip, Tori pulls Uke's arm and pushes their chest. Finishes in Tate-Shiho-Gatame.


## Attacks when Tori and Uke face each other

### Climbing Over
Uke lets themselves fall on their back to pull Tori between their legs. Tori reacts quickly, dodges one of Uke's legs with their hand and quickly climbs over. Finishes with Hon-Kesa-Gatame.
