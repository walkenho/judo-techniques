\* "Katame-waza comprises osai-komi-waza (hold-down techniques)[sic], shime-waza (strangling techniques)[sic] and kansetsu-waza (joint techniques)[sic]. The term ne-waza (mat work] is sometimes used in place of katame-waza, but it is misleading in that not all katame-waza are executed while lying [sic] on the mat. Some stangleholds and joint locks, for example, can be applied from a standing position. As can be seen from the terminology, in grappling the opponent is held, his joints are locked or his limbs bent or twisted, or he can be strangled."
